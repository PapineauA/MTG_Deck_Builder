# MTG_Deck_Builder

My Deck Builder App for Magic: The Gathering!

I wanted to build this application because with other deck building apps it was difficult to keep track of some core concept features that I wanted in my decks, as well as an easy way to keep track of the decks that I had already. I only really care about the Commander format, so that's what the deck builder is really for.

Should you want to run this program on your own local system, first create some environment variables in an env folder in the backend. You'll need host, database, user, password, and port variables. Then simply cd into the backend and type "python script.py"... and wait for it to load a bit as the cards flood into the database.

Some features:
*Highlighting Commander in your list.
*Allowing the user to save their lists, edit them... and be able to close the page and come back later and make changes or view as needed.
\*All cards that are LEGAL in the Commander format availible for the user to create decklists with.
