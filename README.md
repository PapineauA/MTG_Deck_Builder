# MTG_Deck_Builder

My Deck Builder App for Magic: The Gathering!

I wanted to build this application because with other deck building apps it was difficult to keep track of some core concept features that I wanted in my decks, as well as an easy way to keep track of the decks that I had already. I only really care about the Commander format, so that's what the deck builder is really for.

Some features:
Highlighting Commander in your list
Recommender for cards, telling the user to add x amounts of certain cards for a well balanced deck.
Allowing the user to make an account, or to save their lists, edit them... and be able to close the page and come back later and make changes or view as needed.
All cards that are LEGAL in the Commander format.
